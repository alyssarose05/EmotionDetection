This is made to be used in a Linux terminal. Before cloning this repository, please make sure that you have the following programs and Python libraries installed in your terminal:
- Git
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Flask 2.2.2.2 or higher
- render_template
- request

If there is anything that you are missing, you should be able to install them with the `pip install` command, followed by their name.

To install this emotion detector API interface onto your terminal, simply clone this repository in your current directory: `git clone https://github.com/alyssarose05/emotion-website.git`

## Running the server
To run the server and work with the web-based API, use your version of Python to run the `server.py` file. For example, for Python 3.11, you would do `python3.11 server.py`. This will make the Flask server start running at port 5000. 
You will need to launch the application under the 5000 port. This is commonly done by typing `127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.
